# PagePal ‚ôö

"PagePal" is a web extension that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to summarize the content of web pages. With PagePal, users can quickly and easily get an overview of the information on a page, without having to read through the entire page. The extension works by analyzing the text on the page and extracting the most important and relevant information, and then presenting it to the user in a concise and easy-to-read format. This can be particularly useful for users who are short on time or who need to quickly grasp the key points of a page. PagePal can be used on any web page, and users can customize the length and style of the summary to suit their needs.
